# Finiding_Palingram
Palindromes are the words that are spelled the same forward and backward. Palingrams are whole phrases that behave the same way.This project demonstrates how to find palingrams, which are pairs of words that form a palindrome when combined. It first loads a dictionary file as a list of words using the load function from the load_dictionary module. The find_palingrams function then takes this list of words and identifies palingrams within it. It utilizes a nested loop to compare each word with its reverse and checks if the substrings from both words are also present in the dictionary. The resulting palingrams are stored in a list, which is then sorted alphabetically. The script prints the number of palingrams found and can optionally print the sorted palingrams themselves. To use the script, ensure the load_dictionary.py module is available and provide the path to a suitable dictionary file, such as 3of6game.txt.
